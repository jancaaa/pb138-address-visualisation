# pb138-address-visualisation

Goal of this project is to create a tool that lets you analyse, process and visualize statistical information from country addresses (ex. street with longest name, most common street name, etc).

Mainly works with Czech address registry (RUIAN "Výměnný formát"), but it should be extensible enough to use any input (if you write your own Downloader) or generate any output (if you create your own Viewer). You can also write your own Visualiser to try and find some interesting statistics.

This project was created for [PB138](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2016/PB138) course and its code is available under [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

## Modules
- Downloader
- Visualisers
- Viewer

### Downloader
- input: one TXT file containing links to XML files (can be anything with custom downloader)
- output: XML database file (with structure resources/db_schema.xsd)
- written in Python

### Visualisers
- numerous smaller modules
- can be written in any programming language (we mainly use Python through)
- input: database file (with structure resources/db_schema.xsd)
- output: single [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) file containing drawing information (what to draw on map, ex. point on coordinates lat, lng)
- example Visualiser: longest street in region - walks through all regions and finds longest street in each of them

### Viewer
- An application for viewing files generated by visualisers
- Written in JavaScript

Start a HTTP server `python3 -m http.server` and visit <http://localhost:8000/viewer/>
