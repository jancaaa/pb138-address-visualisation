# pb138-address-visualisation

Goal of this project is to create a tool that lets you analyse, process and visualize statistical information from country addresses (ex. street with longest name, most common street name, etc).

This is a school project.

Mainly works with Czech address registry (RUIAN "Výměnný formát"), but it should be extensible enough to use any input (if you write your own parser) or generate any output (if you create your own visualiser).

## Modules
- Parser
- Visualisers
- Viewer

### Parser
- written in Python
- input: one XML file containing address information
- output: XML database in specified directory
- with custom parser input can be basically anything

### Visualisers
- lots of smaller modules
- can be written in any programming language (we mainly use Python through)
- input: database folder (with known structure)
- output: single [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) file containing drawing information (what to draw on map, ex. point on coordinates lat, lng)
- example visualiser: longest street in region - walks through all regions and finds longest street in each of them

### Viewer
- An application for viewing files generated by visualisers
- Written in JavaScript

Start a HTTP server `python3 -m http.server` and visit <http://localhost:8000/vf_viewer/>

## Dependencies
- [python-geojson](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson) – required for visualisation
